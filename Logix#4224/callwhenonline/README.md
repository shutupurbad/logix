Take a screenshot of a guy when hes online (like the one i did)
Extract the archive
Name the screenshot img1.png and put it in the folder where you extracted the archive
Now wait for the guy to go offline, start the script and let your discord lay on your screen while you do something else and it will call the guy as soon as he goes online.
